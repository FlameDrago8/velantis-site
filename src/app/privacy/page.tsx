      <p>
        Velantis LLC (“Velantis,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) operates <em>Drive</em>{" "}
        (the “Application”), an AI-powered driving coaching and education mobile
        application. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use,
        disclose, and protect your personal information when you use the
        Application.
      </p>

      <p>
        By downloading, installing, or using the Application, you agree to the
        collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy
        Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use
        the Application.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We collect several types of information to provide and improve the
        Application.
      </p>

      <h3>1.1 Information You Provide to Us</h3>
      <p>
        When you create an account or use certain features, you may provide us
        with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Account information, including your name and email address. If you
          sign in with Google or Apple, we receive basic account details (such
          as your name and email) from that provider. Account passwords are
          handled by our authentication provider and are not stored by Velantis;
        </li>
        <li>
          Profile information, such as your experience level, learning goals,
          vehicle details, and profile photo (stored on your device); and
        </li>
        <li>
          Communications, including any messages, feedback, or support requests
          you send us.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1.2 Information Collected Automatically During Driving Sessions</h3>
      <p>
        When you activate a driving session in the Application, the following
        data is collected automatically from your mobile device’s sensors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Location and GPS data, including real-time geographic coordinates,
          speed, heading, altitude, and route traveled;
        </li>
        <li>
          Accelerometer data, measuring acceleration and deceleration forces in
          all three axes;
        </li>
        <li>
          Gyroscope data, measuring rotational movement and orientation changes;
        </li>
        <li>
          Motion and activity data, including changes in velocity, cornering
          forces, and braking intensity;
        </li>
        <li>
          Driving behavior metrics, derived from sensor data, including driving
          scores, smoothness ratings, speed compliance assessments, and event
          detection (such as hard braking, rapid acceleration, or sharp turns);
          and
        </li>
        <li>
          Session metadata, including session start and end times, duration, and
          distance traveled.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Additionally, during a driving session the Application may use your
        device’s camera to record video of the road ahead for use in your
        post-drive review.{" "}
        <strong>
          This video is stored locally on your device and is not uploaded to,
          transmitted to, or collected by Velantis.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> The Application only records or collects
        driving session data when you actively start a driving session within
        the Application. The Application does not collect location, camera, or
        sensor data in the background when a driving session is not active.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3 Technical Information</h3>
      <p>
        To operate the Application and its cloud services, our infrastructure
        providers process limited technical information necessary to deliver the
        service, such as an app-instance identifier and your device’s IP
        address. We do not use third-party advertising identifiers, and the
        Application does not include third-party analytics, advertising, or
        crash-reporting software development kits.
      </p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

      <h3>2.1 To Provide and Operate the Application</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Delivering real-time AI-powered driving coaching and feedback during
          driving sessions;
        </li>
        <li>
          Calculating driving scores, performance metrics, and improvement
          tracking;
        </li>
        <li>Managing your account and authenticating your identity;</li>
        <li>
          Providing customer support and responding to your inquiries; and
        </li>
        <li>
          Sending you service-related communications, such as account
          notifications and updates.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 To Improve and Develop Our Products</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Analyzing anonymized and aggregated driving data to improve our AI
          coaching algorithms and scoring methodology;
        </li>
        <li>
          Training and refining our proprietary machine learning models using
          anonymized data;
        </li>
        <li>
          Identifying trends, patterns, and areas for improvement in the
          Application’s features; and
        </li>
        <li>Conducting internal research and development.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <em>
          Sharing your driving sensor data to help train and improve our AI
          models is optional. It only occurs if you turn on “Share Anonymous
          Data” in the Application’s settings, which is off by default. When
          enabled, the sensor data we upload for model training is not
          associated with your name, email, account identifier, or device, and
          cannot reasonably be used to identify you. Our proprietary AI models
          are core assets of Velantis, and these anonymized insights contribute
          to the continuous improvement of these models.
        </em>
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 To Ensure Safety and Compliance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Detecting and preventing fraud, abuse, or unauthorized access;
        </li>
        <li>
          Enforcing our Terms of Use and other applicable policies; and
        </li>
        <li>Complying with applicable legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may share
        your information only in the following limited circumstances:
      </p>

      <h3>3.1 Service Providers</h3>
      <p>
        We may share information with third-party service providers who perform
        services on our behalf. In particular, we use Google Firebase (a Google
        service) for account authentication, cloud database, and file storage,
        and we use Apple services for sign-in and Game Center features. These
        providers process your information to provide services to us and are
        subject to their own privacy policies and applicable confidentiality
        obligations.
      </p>

      <h3>3.2 Legal Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in
        response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order,
        subpoena, or government agency request). Where permitted by law, we will
        notify you of such a request before disclosing your information.
      </p>

      <h3>3.3 Business Transfers</h3>
      <p>
        If Velantis is involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or
        sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that
        transaction. We will notify you of any such change and any choices you
        may have regarding your information.
      </p>

      <h3>3.4 With Your Consent</h3>
      <p>
        We may share your information for any other purpose with your explicit
        consent.
      </p>

      <h3>3.5 Aggregated and Anonymized Data</h3>
      <p>
        We may share aggregated and anonymized data that cannot reasonably be
        used to identify you with third parties for research, analysis,
        benchmarking, or other purposes. For example, we may publish aggregated
        statistics about driving behavior trends.
      </p>

      <h3>3.6 Game Center and Social Features</h3>
      <p>
        The Application integrates with Apple Game Center to offer an optional
        friends leaderboard. If you sign in to Game Center and use this feature,
        your Game Center display name and your driving score may be visible to
        your Game Center friends who also use the Application, and their
        information may be visible to you. This sharing is controlled by Apple
        Game Center and your Game Center settings. If you do not wish to
        participate, you can decline Game Center sign-in or disable Game Center
        in your device settings.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain your personal information for as long as your account is
        active or as needed to provide you with the Application’s services. We
        may also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our
        legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Driving session data associated with your account is retained for as
        long as your account is active. You may request deletion of your account
        and associated data at any time (see Section 7 below).
      </p>
      <p>
        Anonymized and aggregated data derived from your driving sessions may be
        retained indefinitely, as it cannot be used to identify you and is used
        for ongoing improvement of our AI models and services.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement commercially reasonable technical and organizational
        security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized
        access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These measures include
        encryption of data in transit and at rest, access controls, and regular
        security assessments.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of
        electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
        reasonable means to protect your personal information, we cannot
        guarantee its absolute security. You are responsible for maintaining the
        confidentiality of your account credentials.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Children’s and Minors’ Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The Application is designed to be used by individuals learning to drive,
        which in many jurisdictions includes minors (persons under the age of
        18). We take the privacy of minors seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Users under 18:</strong> If you are under 18 years of age, you
        must have the consent of a parent or legal guardian to create an account
        and use the Application. By creating an account for a minor or
        consenting to a minor’s use of the Application, the parent or legal
        guardian agrees to this Privacy Policy on the minor’s behalf and assumes
        responsibility for the minor’s use of the Application.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Users under 13:</strong> The Application is not intended for use
        by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal
        information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have
        collected personal information from a child under 13 without parental
        consent, we will take steps to delete that information promptly. If you
        believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information,
        please contact us at{" "}
        <a href="mailto:velantis.app@gmail.com">velantis.app@gmail.com</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parents and legal guardians may contact us at any time to review,
        update, or request deletion of their child’s personal information by
        contacting us at{" "}
        <a href="mailto:velantis.app@gmail.com">velantis.app@gmail.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>

      <h3>7.1 Access and Correction</h3>
      <p>
        You may access and update certain personal information through your
        account settings within the Application. If you need to access or
        correct information that is not available through your account settings,
        please contact us at{" "}
        <a href="mailto:velantis.app@gmail.com">velantis.app@gmail.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>7.2 Account Deletion</h3>
      <p>
        You may request deletion of your account and associated personal
        information at any time by contacting us at{" "}
        <a href="mailto:velantis.app@gmail.com">velantis.app@gmail.com</a> or
        through the account settings within the Application. Upon receiving a
        verified deletion request, we will delete your personal information from
        our active systems within thirty (30) days, except as required by law or
        for legitimate business purposes (such as fraud prevention). Anonymized
        data that has already been incorporated into our AI models will not be
        affected by a deletion request, as it is no longer personally
        identifiable.
      </p>

      <h3>7.3 Location Data</h3>
      <p>
        You may disable location services for the Application through your
        mobile device’s settings. However, disabling location services will
        prevent the Application from providing its core driving coaching and
        analysis features.
      </p>

      <h3>7.4 Push Notifications</h3>
      <p>
        If the Application offers push notifications, you may opt out of
        receiving them through your mobile device’s settings.
      </p>

      <h3>7.5 Marketing Communications</h3>
      <p>
        If we send marketing emails, you may opt out by following the
        unsubscribe instructions in the email. Please note that even if you opt
        out of marketing communications, we may still send you service-related
        communications.
      </p>

        required by applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
      <p>
        The Application may contain links to third-party websites, services, or
        applications that are not operated by us. This Privacy Policy does not
        apply to third-party services, and we are not responsible for the
        privacy practices of any third party. We encourage you to review the
        privacy policies of any third-party services before providing them with
        your personal information.
      </p>

        the Application from outside the United States, please be aware that
        your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the
        United States, where data protection laws may differ from those in your
        jurisdiction. By using the Application, you consent to the transfer of
        your information to the United States.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes
